To fix the issue, ensure that the selector accurately targets the element you want to apply the pseudo-element to. Use the appropriate level of specificity in the selector to avoid affecting unintended elements.   If necessary, restructure your HTML and consider using actual elements rather than pseudo-elements if the selector becomes too complex.

For example, instead of:

```css
.container::before {
  content: "Some text";
}
```

if only a specific child element needs the pseudo-element, target that child:

```css
.container > .child::before {
  content: "Some text";
}
```
Or use a more precise selector based on the container's properties.

If the complexity is excessive, consider using a different technique for adding the text, for instance an actual element like a `<span>` within the `.container`.

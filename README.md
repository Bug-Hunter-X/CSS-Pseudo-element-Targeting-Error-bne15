# CSS Pseudo-element Targeting Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle CSS bug involving the incorrect targeting of pseudo-elements.  The bug arises from using selectors that are either too broad (affecting unintended elements) or too narrow (failing to target the desired element).

## Problem

The provided CSS uses a `::before` pseudo-element, but the selector might not be accurate enough to target the specific element intended to display the pseudo-element's content.

## Solution

A more precise selector or an adjusted approach to styling, such as using an actual element instead of a pseudo-element, is employed to correctly target the intended element.
